# DMRGenie.jl
A graphical user interface for entanglement renormalization algorithms

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the [DMRjulia](https://github.com/bakerte/DMRJtensor.jl) library for entanglement renormalization.

A live implementation is available on ___ with resources hosted by the the Research Computing Services at the University of Victoria.

To deploy this software on a local machine, we provide the following instructions:
