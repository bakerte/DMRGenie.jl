# DMRGenie.jl

*This software is currently tested with v1.9.3 of Julia and is built on the website by a frozen implementation of DMRjulia*

A graphical user interface for entanglement renormalization algorithms

This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the [DMRjulia](https://github.com/bakerte/DMRJtensor.jl) library for entanglement renormalization.

A live implementation is available on [https://dmrgenie.rs.uvic.ca/](this website) with resources hosted by the the Research Computing Services at the University of Victoria.

To deploy this software on a local machine, we provide the instructions in `/guides/DeveloperGuide`

For modifications to the front end, we provide `/guides/BuilderGuide`
